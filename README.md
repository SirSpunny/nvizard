# nvizard

Neovim Config - heavily relying on [mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/tree/main)

# Environment vars
This config supports some settings via environment varaiables since some settings are device specific and should not be set in this config

| Variable | Default Value |
|----------|---------------|
| `OLLAMA_CLIENT_MODEL` | "llama3" |
| `OLLAMA_CLIENT_HOST` | "127.0.0.1" |
| `OLLAMA_CLIENT_PORT` | "11434" |


## WARNING
This is for my personal workflow. Maintanance is only sporadic and breaking changes won't be handled correctly. But feel free to use this config.
